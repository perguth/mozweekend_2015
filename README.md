- [Developer](#developer)
- [Privacy](#privacy)
- [Community](#community)
- [Voice Recognition](#voice-recognition)
- [FxOS](#fxos)
- [Open Web](#open-web)


## General

- :sparkles: Let users decide which data to share/escalate based on descisions -> Those who share, will share a lot.
- :sparkles: remotestorage.io etc. maybe a way to get to "server side"?
- :-1: whatcanidoformozilla -> what can I do *with* Mozilla. "for" is a bit the wrong attitude here, imho.
- :-1: Mozilla supports site old questions where one can not longer ammend. Why are they there? For me it's just frustrating. At least there should be a way to open a related and new ticket.


## Speed

- :-1: The tab overview makes FF even more slow, if its big.
- :-1: Why does FF take so much idle CPU, why don't you let websites/webapps sleep?
- :-1: Chrome is faster, especially on mobile.
- :question: Why is there this awkward pause when loading a page (compared to Chromium)? @speed


## UI/UX

- :+1: It's easier to pin certificates.
- :+1: There is a tab overview.
- :-1: Why is there no search feature in settings?
- :+1: FF has tags for bookmarks! Yay.
- :-1: The tab overview is a UI/UX disaster.
- :-1: FF messages still suck. "This is embarassing" - it would not have been if you hadn't said it (because I crashed it voluntarily). Why not just gracefully restore and play pretend?!
- :-1: Why is it so hard to create website-apps. Why not like with Chrome?!
- :-1: Restoring old states is such a pain. I often have to fiddle with those `sessionrestore.js` files because `about:sessionrestore` does not work right.
- :-1: Why do icons suck so much with FF compared to Chrome? (Place bookmark on the homescreen)
- :sparkles: Why is there no FF theme for Chromium?
- :question: Why not only the `awesomebar`? @UI
- :-1: Chrome will reload on it's own, when server was unavailable (important for `--app`s)
- :sparkles: Bring FF sync to Chrome. That would be nice.
- :+1: Reload icon in context menu


## Developer

- :sparkles: There is a `Chrome Dev` on mobile. Where is `FF Dev` on mobile?!
- :+1: Focus on bringing tools to developers (FF DEV bravo!).
- :-1: Why does FF Dev tools still feel so clumsy?!
- :-1: Developer does not suggest possible values. Only completion. (Unlike Chromium)
- :question: Why not *make* the developer mode a kind of IDE with which we can write live changes to our source files. @dev
- :sparkles: Easier data storage/attachment to ff profile
- :sparkles: Token cloud to easy install extensions/config ua.


## Privacy

- :sparkles: Include Moxies Convergence.
- :+1: There is FF sync, fully open source, back/front.
- :sparkles: What about the browser fingerprint?! @privacy
- :sparkles: Default: disable third party cookies @ThomasWaldmann
- :sparkles: Push culture forward by enabling crypto tools and device access.
- :sparkles: Use Moxies `Convergence` model for extension signing. @security

## Community

- :-1: Mozilla is totally fragmented, not easy for the lurker to get insight. (Oh, that blog exists too?!)
- :sparkles: Let the user decide how the tab should behave (sleep when not open, cpu share etc)


## Voice Recognition

- :question: Why not use LibriVox ua. for `Speech Corpus`?


## FxOS

- :sparkles: Make FxOS a operation system where average users can create and exchange the UI. Bring diversity to the field! Make diversity and customizability the core tenent.
- :sparkles: I would like to have a easy to use message bus I can pilot from anywhere (especially one-page apps).
- :sparkles: IPFS integration for file/app transferance.
- :question: New core development process?


## Open Web

- :sparkles: Make it easy to shift between OSS browsers. -> Make FF Sync work across platforms.
- :sparkles: Have some easy "office central" extension deployment. Stats building, message queue (see other ticket).

## Notes

* Germany, discoursive process
- Newsletter, Blogs
- Academia *papers)
* Userbase (developers as core?)
- Speed, speed, speed
- Tooling/Interop
- Broaden the term: devs should also include guys speading/installing.
- Differentiate no central answer.
