# Mozweekend 2015

- Speed is paramount, if we can't achieve that we need to abondon ship on some projects.
- - Chrome is faster, especially on mobile.
- - Chrome will reload on it's own, when server was unavailable (important for `--app`s)
- + It's easier to pin certificates.
- + There is a tab overview.
- - Why is there no search feature in settings?
- - The tab overview makes FF even more slow, if its big.
- - The tab overview is a UI/UX disaster.
- + There is FF sync, fully open source, back/front.
- - Chrome holds over 50% of the marketshare. There are already plugins, that are not or delayed available for FF.
- + FF has tags for bookmarks! Yay.

- - Mozilla is totally fragmented, not easy for the lurker to get insight. (Oh, that blog exists too?!)
- - FF messages still suck. "This is embarassing" - it would not have been if you hadn't said it (because I crashed it voluntarily). Why not just gracefully restore and play pretend?!
- - Why is it so hard to create website-apps. Why not like with Chrome?!
- - There is a `Chrome Dev` on mobile. Where is `FF Dev` on mobile?!
- - Why do icons suck so much with FF compared to Chrome? (Place bookmark on the homescreen)
- - Why does FF Dev tools still feel so clumsy?!
- - Why does FF take so much idle CPU, why don't you let websites/webapps sleep? Why do I as a user do not have control?
- - Developer does not suggest possible values. Only completion. (Unlike Chromium)

- ? Why is there no FF theme for Chromium?
- ? Default: disable third party cookies @ThomasWaldmann

- -> Focus on bringing tools to developers (FF DEV bravo!).
- -> Make FxOS a operation system where average users can create and exchange the UI. Bring diversity to the field! Make diversity and customizability the core tenent.
- -> Make FF fast again (switch to webkit?!)
- -> Bring FF sync to Chrome. That would be nice.
- -> Push culture forward by enabling crypto tools and device access.
- + Reload icon in context menu
